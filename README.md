This is a demonstrator of using a static site generator to read thought a list of post and map out each post in a leafletjs map.

This could be used as a way to communicate to potential volunteers where the closest action locations they can participate in etc...

There are more developed options out there, but this is here to provide a lower technical friction option of communicating such information via using github and github pages.

Pull Requests to improve this template will be appreciated.
